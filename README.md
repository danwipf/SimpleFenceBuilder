So far on github:

Pivot Adjustment Tool for Unity3d, just Drag and Drop all scripts to the AssetFolder. Afterwards simply add to any 3d GameObject with a Renderer and MeshFilter the SFB_PivotChanger.cs script.

Add a Transform you want to manipulate to the Pivot_Transform field and hit Change Pivot, or the *Always Change Pivot* boolean.
If anything goes wrong, you can simple reimport the Model by hitting Re-Import inside the struct Property.
